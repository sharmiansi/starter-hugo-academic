I am a postdoctoral research fellow in the Experimental and Computational Multiphase Flow Laboratory at the University of Michigan. My research focusses on investigating the complex characteristics of the single and multiphase flows in diverse engineering applications based on the development and application of the novel experimental and computational techniques. The fundamental understanding of the morphology of the multiphase flows is crucial for maximizing/optimizing the application performances in terms of mixing, heat and mass transfer, energy efficiency, and so forth. I strongly believe that the interdisciplinary research is essential for advancing the conventional understanding of the multiphase flow applications for the greater good of the society and the environment.
